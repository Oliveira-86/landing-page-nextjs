# Landing Page

In digital marketing, a landing page is a standalone web page, created specifically for a marketing or advertising campaign. It’s where a visitor “lands” after they click on a link in an email, or ads from Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places on the web. Unlike web pages, which typically have many goals and encourage exploration, landing pages are designed with a single focus or goal, known as a call to action (or CTA, for short). Based on this importance in the development market, I decided to make this project with a beautiful designer and animations.

## The App

#### - Web

<div alignItem="end" justfyContent="spaceBetween"> 
  <img width="550" height="300" src="src/assets/GIF/video 1.gif">
  <img width="550" height="300" src="src/assets/GIF/video 2.gif">
  <img width="550" height="300" src="src/assets/GIF/video 3.gif">
 </div> 
 
 
 
#### - Tablet

<div alignItem="end" justfyContent="spaceBetween">

  <img width="300" height="450" src="src/assets/GIF/mobile 2.gif">
  <img width="300" height="450" src="src/assets/GIF/mobile 3.gif">
 </div>
